This program is developed with the intention of helping developers who decide to build their bot using KookyBot with
Java to have a better understanding of [our documentation](https://kookybot.rtfd.io).

Any contribution to this project (e.g. adding more code example) are welcome. If you want to add more code examples,
please create a new Java file with a meaningful name and add it to the `src/main/java/io/github/kookybot` folder.
